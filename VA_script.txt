Mod for Arma Reforger. Game is set in 1989 and depicts realistic combat between US and USSR. 
The mod is a singleplayer mission that sees you make full use of Arma's authentic mortar mechanics.
Gameplay will consist of 20-30 minutes of fulfilling firemissions. All firemission requests will be relayed over ingame radio and be voice acted.
Here's a playthrough of an early version with my own placeholder voicelines. (Do not use this as tone guide for your own recordings).

In this script certain words will be enclosed in tags <i>. These denote important information for the player, and must preferably be spoken clearly.
The script is split into VA's (voice actors), which are dialogue that, is not necesarily the same ingame character, but can use the same voice due to how the mission is structured.
A single voice actor can voice multiple VA sections if they can change their voice.

I want to keep it authentic. Meaning I am not really looking for the typical gritty military voice.

Situation (not to be narrated):
	The Cold War has gone lukewarm. Proxy wars has slowly turned into small scale direct conflict between the nuclear powers in remote third-world countries.
	The island of Everon is eyed by the USSR, and its Government has invited a small US force to build a camp there to encourage the soviet's better judgement. 
	Though the token force is small, as there is little interest in pulling from more important fronts to this ocean rock.
	
Mission (not to be narrated):
	You crew a mortar and has been stationed on a hill outpost. The outpost is not yet finished, and your officer is on his way from the nearby camp with the shell ammunition.
